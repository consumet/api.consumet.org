## Types Of Contributions We're Looking For

In short, we welcome any type of contribution you are willing to provide. No
contribution is too small. We gladly accept contributions such as:

- Documentation improvements: from small typo corrections to major document reworks
- Helping others by answering questions in pull requests
- Fixing [known bugs](https://github.com/consumet/extensions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ABug)

## Ground Rules & Expectations
Before we begin, here are a few things we anticipate from you (and that you should expect from others):

* Be respectful and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. Each person has their own views and opinions about the project. Try to listen to each other and reach an agreement or compromise.

## How To Contribute
If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/consumet/extensions/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/consumet/extensions/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix or new provider, open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a major refactor, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.
